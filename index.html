<p>Welcome to my website! I'm currently 17 years old residing in New York. I'll be graduating high school in June 2018. I enjoy taking photos, reading, and fashion. I'm interested in majoring in technology and fashion and trying to find a way to merge the two together. However, I'm open to trying new things and I love to travel! Thank you for taking the time to visit my website and have a great day!</p>
